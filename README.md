# Cypress Project

Welcome to the Cypress project based on the Page Object Model! This project is intended to provide a strong and stable framework for end-to-end testing of web applications using Cypress. The Page Object Model pattern organizes and improves test code readability by encapsulating interactions with web elements on distinct pages of the application.
